        a mobile town app template. This means that the mobile application would serve as a central hub for any city/township to provide
        information and resources to its citizens. Through the app, citizens can create user accounts, find official documents,
        receive live news and alerts, amongst other capabilities.

        We had weekly standup meetings and were assigned 2-3 tasks to complete each week. My specific tasks included
        coding a side menu to frame the entire app, integrating OpenWeather API for live weather data, designing and 
        coding a template for a tab holding forms and documents, and designing and coding a template for the home page
        of the app.`,

        towards beginner hackers, but experienced hackers were welcome too, on one condition: they had to learn a new language through the
        hackathon. My partner and I both didn't know PHP, so we decided to try to use CakePHP to build a website for a shared passion of ours, 
        creative writing. Thus, Creative Corner was born. Creative Corner was based on a CakePHP Getting Started guide; the website
        is intended to act as a hub for creative writers to receive daily prompts, write stories, share their stories with others, and browse
        others' stories. We used Figma to design the application and CakePHP to code the app. We used MySQL for our backend.`,
